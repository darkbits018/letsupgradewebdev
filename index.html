        <h1>Microgravity:Future of VR gaming is here</h1>

        <p>
            The gaming industry has come a long way to a point where everything feels so real on
            our screens.
            Thanks to 4K gaming and better rendering of frames,
            the games feel more immersive than ever.
            However, that is not where we are going to stop.
            The door to the future of gaming lies in VR.
            Virtual Reality or VR is already getting better and could be a blast in the coming years.
            Microgravity has seen the opportunity and hopped on the wagon as early as possible.

            In the free roam theme, the company has other games apart from FarCry 4. It is not only the free roam that
            users are limited to, the company has also set up various other stations to offer different gaming
            experiences.
            There is a mini booth as well that offers a variety of games.

            In a nutshell, VR gaming is the future and Microgravity aims to bring it to you and that too at an
            affordable price.
